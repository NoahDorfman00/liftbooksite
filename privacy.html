                <h1>Privacy Policy for Liftbook</h1>
                <p class="legal-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 27, 2025</p>

                <p>Liftbook (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is a personal workout logging app. This Privacy Policy explains how
                    we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect the information you enter into the app, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Workout data</strong>: exercise names, sets, reps, weights, and any titles or notes you
                        add</li>
                    <li><strong>Dates and basic usage data</strong>: for example, when workouts are created or edited
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not collect your name, email, phone number, or other contact details inside the app itself
                    unless you choose to share them with us separately (for example, if you contact support by email).
                </p>

                <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use your information solely to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Store and display your workouts in the app</li>
                    <li>Keep your workout history available across sessions and devices (when synced)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or tracking you across other apps or websites.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Where Your Data Is Stored</h2>
                <p>Your data is stored in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your device’s local storage (for offline access)</li>
                    <li>Google Firebase Realtime Database, a cloud service provided by Google, for syncing and backup
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Firebase may process data on servers located in different regions. For more details about how Google
                    handles data, please refer to Google’s own privacy policy.</p>

                <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>We use Google Firebase to store and manage your workout data. Firebase acts as our data processor and
                    does not use your workout data for its own advertising.</p>
                <p>We do not share your workout data with other third parties except as required by law.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
                <p>We retain your workout data for as long as you use the app.</p>
                <p>You can delete individual workouts directly within the app; this will remove them from your local
                    storage and, when synced, from Firebase.</p>
                <p>If you would like your data deleted from our Firebase backend entirely, you can contact us at
                    <a href="mailto:n.dorfman00@gmail.com">n.dorfman00@gmail.com</a> with the subject line “Liftbook
                    Data Deletion Request”. After verifying your request, we will delete your stored workout data from
                    our servers within a reasonable time.</p>

                <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
                <p>Liftbook is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
                    information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 is using the app and has
                    provided data that should be removed, please contact us at
                    <a href="mailto:n.dorfman00@gmail.com">n.dorfman00@gmail.com</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Security</h2>
                <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, no system is
                    completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your information.</p>

                <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated”
                    date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes take effect means you accept
                    the revised policy.</p>

                <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at:</p>
